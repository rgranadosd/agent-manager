"""A two-agent CrewAI crew.

A researcher (with one tool) and an editor run two sequential tasks. The
researcher answers the question using the lookup tool, and the editor shortens
the answer. Each /chat call runs both agents and the model behind them, so a
single request produces a small multi-agent trace. Pinned to crewai 1.1.0 for
dependency compatibility.
