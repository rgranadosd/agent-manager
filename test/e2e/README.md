# AMP End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests that drive the Agent Management Platform through its public
HTTP API. Written in Go with [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) /
[Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/).

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # set OPENAI_API_KEY; other defaults match quick-start install
make e2e-test                          # run all suites (from repo root)
make e2e-test SUITE=monitors           # one suite
make e2e-test FOCUS="Project Deletion Conflict"   # one spec by description
```


## Layout

```
framework/   API client, config, shared types, assertion helpers
operations/  one function per API call, grouped by domain (no test logic)
testsetup/   shared, idempotent provisioning of reused fixtures
tests/       the suites — one package (Go test binary) per domain
```

A spec reads as `It` steps that delegate to `operations/` and `testsetup/`.

## Configuration

All config is environment variables with defaults matching the quick-start
install (see `.env.example`). 

## Shared fixtures

Building an agent is slow (the suite budgets up to 20 min per build), so
expensive fixtures are **built once and reused by name** across suites and
re-runs. They persist between runs and are reused as long as they exist — but the
root cleanup suite (`tests/e2e_suite_test.go`, label `cleanup`) deletes
`e2e-test-*` resources older than 1 hour, so a run started more than an hour after
the last rebuilds them fresh.

| Fixture | Provisioned by |
|---------|----------------|
| Shared project (`e2e-test-shared`) | `testsetup.EnsureProject` |
| Single-env IT helpdesk agent | `testsetup.SetupSharedITHelpdeskAgent` |
| Two-env promotion infra + agent | `testsetup.EnsurePromotableInfra` / `SetupSharedPromotableITHelpdeskAgent` |
| Catalog kind | published by the `catalog` suite |

The `agent` suite is the canonical builder; other suites reuse by name. All
`testsetup` helpers are idempotent (check-then-reuse).

## Parallel execution (important for setup code)

CI and `make e2e-test` run with `ginkgo -p`. What that means:

- One suite runs at a time, but Ginkgo runs **that suite as N separate OS
  processes** and splits its specs (`Describe` blocks) across them. So specs in
  the same suite run at the same time, in different processes.
- Those processes **don't share memory.** Each has its own copy of `Client`,
  `Cfg`, etc., so each process must build its own.

**The trap:** a `BeforeSuite` runs on *every* one of the N processes. If it
*creates a shared resource* (e.g. the `e2e-test-shared` project), all N processes
try to create the same thing at once and collide (→ `409 Conflict`), which can
also leave the shared agent in a wedged state.

Where each hook runs, and what to use it for:

| Setup hook | Runs… | Use for |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `BeforeSuite` | on **every** process | `Client`/`Cfg` setup only — nothing shared |
| `BeforeAll` | once, on the single process that runs its `Describe` | a resource used by **one `Describe` only** (stays lazy — skipped when that block is filtered out) |
| `SynchronizedBeforeSuite` | phase 1 **once** (one process); phase 2 on **every** process | a resource shared across **multiple `Describe` blocks** — phase 1 provisions it once, phase 2 gives each process its own `Client`/`Cfg` |

`testsetup.SynchronizedSharedITHelpdeskAgent` is a ready-made phase pair for the
shared agent.

## Adding a test

1. Put the raw API call in `operations/<domain>/` (assert status there).
2. Add the spec to `tests/<domain>/`, reusing shared fixtures via `testsetup`.
3. Follow the setup convention above; guard creates for re-runs / parallelism.
4. Verify: `go vet ./...` and `make e2e-test FOCUS="<your spec>"`.
