// AttachOnFailure registers a deferred diagnostic that is added to the Ginkgo report
// (and therefore the JUnit XML, via --junit-report) only when the current spec fails.
//
// Wait helpers that poll with Eventually should capture the last observed state — the
// query scope, the last HTTP status, the last response body — into a variable and pass
// a getter here. On a timeout the raw context lands in the report instead of just a
// terse matcher mismatch, so CI failures are triageable without re-running locally.
//
// The getter is invoked once, at cleanup time, only on failure — so retries never spam
// the report and a passing spec attaches nothing.
